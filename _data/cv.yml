research:

  - title: Deep Learning
    link: https://github.com/bamford/physcomp
    details: |
      This work focusses on developing a neural network architecture
      and training approach for learning meaningful intrinsic
      characteristics of multi-component systems in the scenario where
      the available images suffer from a variety of observational
      effects. The prototype for this is modelling galaxy structure
      using data from astronomical surveys, but the concept is widely
      applicable.

  - title: Intracluster Light
    link: https://github.com/IntraClusterLight
    details: |
      Novel approaches to challenging problem of detecting and
      characterising the extremely diffuse starlight in galaxy
      clusters, in preparation for the upcoming EUCLID mission.

  - title: MegaMorph
    link: https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/astronomy/megamorph/
    details: |
      PI of project to develop multi-wavelength galaxy decomposition techniques and software (C, IDL, Python). $1M funding from Qatar National Research Fund.

  - title: H&alpha;-NMR
    link: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13963.x
    details: |
      Collaboration with statisticians at Carnegie Mellon University to apply newly developed 'Nonparametric Mixture Regression' method to examine components in the galaxy H&alpha; distribution.

  - title: GAMA

    details: |
      Co-I of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey, a large international collaboration studying structure over a range of scales. Contributed to more than 30 journal papers.

  - title: Galaxy Zoo
    link: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/about/research
    details: |
      Key member of the team behind multiple stages of the Galaxy Zoo citizen science project. Responsible for processing and debiasing data into a science-ready form. Contributed to ~50 journal papers, including 5 by PhD students under my supervision.

  - title: Zooniverse
    link: https://www.zooniverse.org
    details: |
      Founding Science Director of the Zooniverse, a citizen science framework and community developed from the original Galaxy Zoo, which has enabled millions of people to contribute to research and helped hundreds of scientists get the data they need.

  - title: Spiking Neural Networks
    link: https://github.com/bamford/Brian2STDPMNIST
    details : |
      To gain a better understanding of learning in the brain, I worked on training a simple spiking neural network (SNN) via spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), using the Brian2 simulator. I started by reproducing the results of a paper that performed unsupervised learning to classify digits. With two pairs of undergraduate project students, we investigated the advantages of SNNs compared to a variety of conventional artificial neural networks. I then developed and implemented a form of supervised learning by association. I also had some success extending this approach to training to a multi-layer SNN with STDP.
