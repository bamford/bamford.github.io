Here is a record of the teaching and project supervision I've done, as much for myself as anyone else!

## Postgraduate

### Lecture courses

#### Scientific Programming with Python

I have taught variations of this course for most of the past ten years, originally for PhD students in the School of Physics at Nottingham, then as part of the [Midlands Physics Alliance](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/mpags) (and hence to PhD students at Nottingham, Birmingham, Warwick, and occasionally Leicester, Loughborough and Keele). It has also been attended by undergrad project students, postdocs and occasionally professors!

The module is now delivered jointly to Masters students on our [MSc Machine Learning in Science](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/course/taught/machine-learning-in-science-msc) programme and PhD students via MPAGS. The latest course materials [can be found here](http://mpags-python.github.io).

## Undergraduate

I am co-leader of First Year (since 2018/19), with primary responsibilities for 
engagement and assessement.

### Lecture courses

#### Quantitative Physics
First-year core module, lecturer 2015/16 -- present, convenor 2016/17 -- present.

#### Research Techniques in Astronomy
Fourth-year module, lecturer 2013/14 -- 2018/19.

#### Structure of Galaxies
Second-year module, lecturer 2012/13.

#### Extreme Astrophysics
Third-year module, shadow 2012/13 -- present.

### Third year projects

I supervise various projects, often using the School's <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/astronomy/observatory.php">observatory</a>.
I also manage the maintenance and development of this facility, and coordinate the training of general users.
