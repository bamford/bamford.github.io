Here is a record of the teaching and project supervision I've done, as much for myself as anyone else!

## Postgraduate

### Programmes

I co-founded the [MSc Machine Learning in Science](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/course/taught/machine-learning-in-science-msc) programme at the University of Nottingham, and continue to assist with its administration.

### Lecture courses

#### Scientific Programming with Python

I have taught variations of this course in most years from 2011/12 to 2022/23, originally for PhD students in the School of Physics at Nottingham, then as part of the [Midlands Physics Alliance](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/mpags) (and hence to PhD students at Nottingham, Birmingham, Warwick, and occasionally Leicester, Loughborough and Keele). It has also been attended by undergrad project students, postdocs and occasionally professors!

From 2019/20 to 2022/23 the module was also delivered to Masters students on our [MSc Machine Learning in Science](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/course/taught/machine-learning-in-science-msc) programme and PhD students via [MPAGS](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/mpags). The teaching materials, including slides and videos, are [available here](http://mpags-python.github.io/old). In 2023/24, I passed the course on to Dr Mike Smith, who has substantially redeveloped the teaching and assessent. The latest course materials [can be found here](http://mpags-python.github.io).

## Undergraduate

I am Examinations Officer for the School of Physics and Astronomy (since 2022/23).

I was co-leader of First Year from 2018/19 to 2022/23, with primary responsibilities for 
engagement and assessement.

### Lecture courses

### Third year projects

I supervise various projects, often using the School's <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/astronomy/observatory.php">observatory</a>.
I also managed the maintenance and development of this facility, and coordinated the training of general users,
from 2011 to 2020.
