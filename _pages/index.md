I'm an Associate Professor in the [School of Physics and Astronomy](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/physics) at the [University of Nottingham](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk).

I teach [undergraduate and postgraduate courses](/teaching/), supervise [PhD students](/supervision/), and work on various [research projects](research).

My research mainly focusses on improving our understanding of galaxies, but I also have developing interests in machine learning and computational neuroscience.
